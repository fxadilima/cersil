# Bab 35

### Notes

Versi bahasa Inggris berikut dimulai dari Bab 35, halaman 26, yang adalah kelanjutan dari [bagian sebelumnya](/yttlj/1354/undangan-misterius.mdx).
Untuk mengendorkan tekanan psikologis, karena bagian ini sangat sulit, sebaiknya kita beralih ke bagian lain untuk sementara.

Di bagian ini diceritakan bahwa saat itu tak lebih dari 'bulan kedua', yang memakai patokan penanggalan Imlek, dan itu sekitar bulan Maret 1354, 
sedangkan pertemuan di Shaolin itu sendiri dijadwalkan berlangsung pada bulan Juni, yaitu bulan kelima dalam penanggalan Imlek. Ini berarti masih jauh 
dari musim dingin, yaitu saat di mana Toqto'a mulai menyerang Gaoyou (wilayah Zhang Shicheng). 

Berarti peristiwa Zhang Shicheng mendeklarasikan diri sebagai Raja Zhou di Gaoyou itu tak jauh dari sini.

## Mengorek Keterangan

Even after his acupoints were sealed, Shou Nanshan did not lose his physical strength;
he carried out Zhao Min’s instructions diligently. He was the one who dragged all nine
corpses and buried them in the rear yard, and he also fetched water to clean the temple
from all the bloodstains. His martial art skill might be mediocre, but his culinary skill
could be considered first class. As Zhang Wuji and Zhao Min enjoyed the meat and vegetable dishes he prepared, they heaped him with praises.

After everything was settled, Zhang and Zhao two people began interrogating him
about the ‘Lion-slaying Heroes’ Assembly’. Contrary to their expectation, Shou Nanshan
did not even try to conceal anything from them, but too bad his companions did not regard him too highly, so that in many things nobody had ever told him anything. He only
knew that the Shaolin Temple Abbot, Reverend Kong Wen, had assigned Yuan Zhen to
preside over this assembly. Yuan Zhen, acting on behalf of Kong Wen and Kong Zhi, two
divine monks, had broadcasted invitations to all heroes and warriors from all schools
and sects, clans and societies around the world, to gather at the Shaolin Temple on the
Duanwu day, to discuss a very important matte

Zhang Wuji asked to see the invitation. It was addressed to Fu Chenzi, Gu Songzi, Gui
Zangci, and other sword masters of Diancang Pai of Yunnan. The sword masters of
Diancang had been famous for quite a while, but they were living way down south in
Yunnan, and had never had any contact with the Wulin characters of the Central
Plains. This time even Shaolin Pai invited them to come. It was clear that the scale of
this assembly was to be magnificent. Shaolin Pai was the Wulin leader. When Kong
Wen and Kong Zhi personally issued an invitation, no matter what important matter
the addressee was facing, they would lay it aside and come to attend the meeting.

Zhang Wuji noticed that the invitation did not have too many characters on it; it simply
said, ‘Respectfully inviting (you) on the Duan Yang festival, to get together at Shaolin, to
enjoy goblets of wine and be merry with the heroes of the world.’ There was no reference on ‘lion-slaying’ at all.

“Why did that Qin Laowu say this meeting was called ‘Lion-slaying Heroes’ Assembly’?”
Zhang Wuji asked.


Shou Nanshan, with a smug look on his face, said, “Zhang-ye [Master Zhang] did not
know it, but my Shifu has captured a very important character who is called Jin Mao
Shi Wang Xie Xun. For this kind of accomplishment, our Shaolin Pai wants to show our
face in front of all the world’s heroes. We are going to kill this Jin Mao Shi Wang in public, that is why this meeting is called the ‘Lion-slaying Heroes’ Assembly’.”
Suppressing his anger Zhang Wuji asked again, “What kind of character is this Jin Mao
Shi Wang? Have you seen him? How did your Shifu capture him? Currently, where is
this person being detained at?”

“This fellow Jin Mao Shi Wang,” Shou Nanshan said, “Hey, hey, he is truly magnificent.
He is twice as tall as Xiao Ren, his upper arm is thicker than Xiao Ren’s thigh. Apart
from everything else, whenever he is staring at you with that pair of sparkling bright
eyes of his, you would feel that your soul is flying out of your body. Even without fighting, you would kowtow and beg for mercy …”

Zhang Wuji and Zhao Min exchanged a glance, while Shou Nanshan continued, “My
Shifu battled him for seven days and seven nights without clear decision of victory and
defeat. Later on, my Shifu has gotten angry and launched his earth-shattering ‘qin long
fu hu gong’ [capturing dragon, subduing tiger skill]; finally he was able to defeat him.
Right now, this Jin Mao Shi Wang is detained in a large iron cage inside our Temple’s Da
Xiong Bao Dian [lit. great heroism precious hall]; with seven or eight pure steel chain
links bound around his body …”

The more Zhang Wuji listened, the angrier he got. “I told you to tell me the truth, and
not such rubbish!” he roared, “Do you want me to take your life? Jin Mao Shi Wang Xie
Daxia has lost his vision, how can you say he has a pair of sparkling bright eyes?”

As his lies were exposed on the spot, Shou Nanshan busily said, “Yes! Yes! Xiao Ren
must be mistaken.”

“Now tell me, have you or have you not seen him [orig. lao3 ren2 jia1 – senior]?” Zhang
Wuji asked, “What does Xie Daxia look like? Tell me.”

In reality, Shou Nanshan had not seen Xie Xun at all. Knowing that he could no longer
lie, he was afraid of his life, so he hastily said, “Xiao Ren does not dare to lie. Actually, I
only heard what other brothers have said.”

All Zhang Wuji wanted was the exact location of Xie Xun’s imprisonment; but after repeated interrogation, Shou Nanshan still was not able to give him any new information.
He thought this matter must be of great importance and was held in the strictest confidence, so of course a small peon like Shou Nanshan did not have any access to the information. Therefore, Zhang Wuji had no choice but to let it go. Luckily, the Duanyang
festival was still some times away, since it was only the second month, so he still had
time to wait until they were fully recovered from their injuries.
