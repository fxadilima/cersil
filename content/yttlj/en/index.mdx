## List of characters

The following is a list of characters from the wuxia novel Yitian Tulong Ji[^yitian-tulong-ji] by Jin Yong. Some of these characters are fictionalised 
personas of, or are based on, actual historical figures, such as Zhu Yuanzhang, Chang Yuchun, Xu Da, Zhang Sanfeng and Chen Youliang. These characters 
have been used _loosely_ as the base to tell the story. Thus, the story has been altered heavily.

A lot of historical figures has been added to the story, mainly Toghon Temur, Empress Qi (sometimes written as Empress Gi or Empress Ki), and adopted the name Ki Seung Nyang.
Although using the name 'Ki Seung Nyang', but this character has nothing to do with Korean drama played by Ha Ji-won, in which the Empress Qi have an affair with 
Wang Jeong (later on, King Chunghye of Goryeo). In this story, Wang Jeong is actually an enemy of Ki Seung Nyang, and the main reason why she left 
her hometown in the first place.

In the story, Ki Seung Nyang is one of the main characters, and actually responsible for many events in Zhang Wuji's life and turning points. She is 
one of 7 personal disciples of Yang Dingtian — Ming Jiao's Archbishop in Zhongyuan at the time. In this case Yang Xiao, Fan Yao and Tajkis were among them. Yang Dingtian gave them a very serious task, translating a message written by Ahmad Fanakati and a historical book written by Rashid al-Din Hamadani, into 
languages understood by Han people and Goryeo. This task was never totally completed, but nonetheless, the books can be well understood by people who 
read them.

Ki Seung Nyang was also the student of Duoluo Haoyou — a former Beggar Clan's disciple, who runaway to Liaodong at the time of chaos, after Xiangyang 
being defeated by Kublai Khan.

Ki Seung Nyang's name can be written as Han Chinese's name Qi Shengniang, and thus she introduced herself using this name, whenever possible. Sometimes 
she use names like 'Qi Furen' (Mrs. Qi) to call herself among her friends. Her fellow disciples of Yang Dingtian call her 'Qi Shimei', which means 
'Seventh Apprentice Sister'.

[^yitian-tulong-ji]: Yi Tian Tu Long Ji (倚天屠龙记 or 倚天屠龍記) is the title of Louis Cha's novel, which has been adapted by movies and television series under the title 'The Heavenly Sword and The Dragon Slaying Saber'.

### Main Characters

- Zhang Wuji (張無忌), is the leader of Ming Jiao — Chinese Manichaean Cult. At the age of 21 he rescued Ming Jiao from disaster, but naively accepted 
  advises from it's leaders, in particular Peng Yingyu, who taught that 'A young and powerful Bright King will come to rescue his people from misfortune', 
  that triggered more than 300 rebellions in the south. The yound and 'Bright King' has been interpreted as Zhang Wuji by his followers. But the previously 
  successful rebels like Xu Shouhui and Liu Futong does not like Zhang Wuji, so they never listen to his advise. He eventually alter the teaching of Peng Yingyu, 
  to follow the original ideas of Mani, although he does not restore many rules that he found to be too strict and not very useful.

- Zhao Min (趙敏), is a beloved daughter of Chaghan Temur and Lady Li. She met Zhang Wuji at the age of 11, and start following him ever since. She always knew 
  that Zhang Wuji is the love of her life, and she does not care much about beautiful women who also love him.

- Zhou Zhiruo (周芷若), is the most beloved apprentice of Miejue Shitai, the leader of Emei Pai. After Miejue's death, she becomes the leader of Emei Pai, 
  although this decision was made because she wanted to take revenge against Zhang Wuji's betrayal. 

- Ki Seung Nyang or Qi Huanghou (Empress Qi). She is the seventh disciple of Yang Dingtian, and the mother of the Crown Price, Ayushiridara.

- Ah Xiu (阿修) or Bilguun Khatun. Under the guidance of Ki Seung Nyang, Ah Xiu become more powerful than Zhou Zhiruo.

- Lihua or Badamlyanhua Khatun, is the Khatun of Ningxia. At the time, her mother acts as regent due to her young age. 

- Xiao Zhao (小昭) is Han Qianye and Daiqisi's daughter. Her mother sends her as a spy to infiltrate the Ming Cult and find the location 
  of the "Heaven and Earth Great Shift" in order to atone for her mother's loss of virginity. Xiaozhao becomes a servant of Yang Buhui ⤔  the Yangs 
  suspect her of being a spy from the six orthodox schools so they bind her in chains to restrict her movements. Xiaozhao runs into Zhang Wuji 
  and narrowly escapes death with him in the secret tunnel. She falls in love with Zhang Wuji but can never be with him because she has to take her 
  mother's place as a virginal Sacred Maiden to save her mother's life. She eventually becomes the new leader of the Persian Ming Cult and returns 
  to its headquarters in Persia. Jin Yong mentioned in the epilogue of the novel that Xiaozhao is his favourite character. In this story, Xiao Zhao 
  will finally restore the original Manichaeism, which does not mention anything about the leader of the cult has to be a woman — or, further more — a virgin. 
  Mani himself is obviously a man. Thus, after this, she will be on her way back to Zhongyuan to find her one and only love — Zhang Wuji.

- Yellow Dressed Maiden, a descendant of Yang Guo, who does not have personal name, only known by her surname as Miss Yang. She becomes a close friend of Ah Xiu.


### Ming Cult (Ming Jiao)

- The Bright Left and Right Messengers serve as the cult leader's deputies.

  + Yang Xiao (楊逍) is the Bright Left Messenger (光明左使) and Yang Buhui's father. During the period of internal conflict in the cult, 
    he served as the cult's acting leader and attempted to master part of the "Heaven and Earth Great Shift" to secure his legitimacy 
    as there were others who disapproved of his leadership. After Zhang Wuji becomes the cult leader, Yang Xiao serves as his advisor 
    and becomes his close friend and confidant.
  + Fan Yao (范遙) is the Bright Right Messenger (光明右使). Subsequent to Yang Dingtian's disappearance, he disfigured himself 
    and disguised himself as a mute monk called Kutoutuo (苦頭陀) so that he could infiltrate Chaghan Temür's army and serve 
    as a spy for the Ming Cult. His cover is blown when he helps the six major orthodox schools escape from Wan'an Monastery after 
    they are captured and held captive there by Zhao Min.

  Both of them were also personal apprentice of Yang Dingtian.
  

- Ah Luo (阿罗) is the fifth disciple of Yang Dingtian. She is the mother of Ah Xiu, who will become Bilguun Khatun of Xiangyang. Ah Luo is actually the real 
  love in Toghon Temur's life. She was the first one who give herself as a concubine of Toghon Temur, in his wedding night with Danashiri.

- Mei Jian (梅劍 or 梅剑) is the sixth disciple of Yang Dingtian, and is the mother of Lihua, who will be Badamlyanhua Khatun of Ningxia. Trapped together 
  in the palace with two of her fellow Ming Jiao's disciples, Mei Jian has no choice but becoming a concubine of Toghon Temur to save their lives at the time.

- The Four Guardian Kings (四大護教法王), assist the leader in overseeing the cult's activities. They are ranked in order of seniority:

  + Daiqisi (黛綺絲), or Tajkis, nicknamed "Purple Dress Dragon King" (紫衫龍王), is one of the three Sacred Maidens of the Persian Ming Cult. 
    She is of mixed heritage (Persian-Chinese) and was originally sent to China to steal the lost manual of the 'Heaven and Earth Great Shift' 
    and became Yang Dingtian's goddaughter. After defeating Han Qianye in the icy lake, she was promoted to the position of a guardian king in the Chinese Ming Cult. 
    However, she had fallen in love with Han Qianye after the duel so she eventually eloped with him and settled with him on Divine Snake Island, 
    where their daughter Xiao Zhao was born. As she had broken her vow of celibacy, she faced execution if the Persian Ming Cult found her. 
    Thus, she disguised herself as an old woman and called herself Golden Flower Granny, or Jinhua Popo (金花婆婆) to match Han Qianye's nickname, 
    'Silver Leaf Gentleman'. She eventually returns to Persia with Xiaozhao after convincing her daughter to take her place as a Sacred Maiden.
  
  + Yin Tianzheng (殷天正), nicknamed 'White Brows Eagle King' or Baimei Yin Wang (白眉鷹王), is Yin Yewang and Yin Susu's father, and Zhang Wuji's 
    maternal grandfather. He left the Ming Cult during its internal conflict and founded the Heavenly Eagle Cult in his home region of Jiangnan. 
    After Zhang Wuji becomes the Ming Cult's leader, the Heavenly Eagle Cult merged into the Ming Cult and Yin Tianzheng continued serving 
    as a guardian king. Yin Tianzheng eventually dies of exhaustion while fighting the three Shaolin elders to save Xie Xun.
  
  + Xie Xun (謝遜), nicknamed 'Golden Haired Lion King' or Jinmao Shi Wang (金毛獅王), is Zhang Wuji's godfather. His most powerful skill is 
    the Lion's Roar (獅吼功), which allows him to project his inner energy through sound waves and cause internal injuries to everyone 
    in the vicinity. His family was murdered by his former mentor Cheng Kun, who disappeared after committing the atrocity. 
    Guided by fury, he went on a rampage to kill many people and push the blame to Cheng Kun, in the hope of forcing Cheng Kun 
    to come out of hiding, but to no avail. After he kidnapped Zhang Cuishan and Yin Susu, Yin blinded him with her darts in self-defence 
    when he was in a violent fit of insanity. His insanity was cured when he heard the cries of their newborn son, which reminded him of 
    his own deceased son. He accepted their offer to be the godfather of their son, whom he named "Wuji" in memory of his son. 
    The families and associates of Xie Xun's victims forgive him after his final confrontation with Cheng Kun. Xie Xun ultimately becomes 
    a Buddhist monk for the rest of his life to seek peace and redemption for his past sins.
  
  + Wei Yixiao (韋一笑), nicknamed 'Green Winged Bat King' JIngyi Fuwang (青翼蝠王), is unmatched in his qinggong prowess in the jianghu. 
    He once accidentally infected himself with an icy venom while practising the skill Icy Palm (寒冰綿掌). Since then, he has to routinely 
    consume the warm blood of living creatures (including humans) to keep himself warm. Zhang Wuji cures him later by using the Nine Yang Divine Skill 
    to purge the venom from his body.

- Yang Buhui (楊不悔) is Yang Xiao and Ji Xiaofu's daughter. Her name literally means "no regrets" to reflect her mother's love for Yang Xiao. 
  Zhang Wuji helps her escape from Miejue after her mother's death and leads her on a perilous journey to bring her safely to her father. 
  She regards Zhang Wuji as a surrogate elder brother for his care and concern towards her. The trauma of witnessing her mother's death 
  makes her become paranoid of anyone who could be a potential enemy and this intensifies her hatred towards Miejue. This is evident in 
  her treatment towards Xiaozhao, when she and her father suspect Xiaozhao of being a spy from the Emei School. It also made her extremely 
  protective towards her father and Zhang Wuji, whom she sees as what is left of her family and trust only them. She falls in love with 
  Yin Liting, her mother's original fiancé, and marries him despite the large age gap between them. They are expecting a child near 
  the end of the _original_ novel.

- Zhu Yuanzhang (朱元璋) is an ambitious minor leader of the cult who eventually unites the rebel forces under his control and leads them 
  to overthrow the Yuan dynasty. He betrays the cult later and becomes the founding emperor of the Ming dynasty.

- Chang Yuchun (常遇春) is a cult member who travels with Zhang Wuji to Butterfly Valley to seek treatment from Hu Qingniu. He is eventually 
  saved by Zhang but loses forty years of his life.

- Xu Da (徐達) is a minor leader of the cult. Zhang Wuji presents him with Yue Fei's military text Book of Wumu. Xu Da, who is already a skilled 
  military tactician, studies the book that refined his tactical skills and uses his knowledge to lead the rebels to victory in the battles 
  against the Yuan forces and ultimately captures the Yuan capital Khanbaliq.

  + Leng Qian (冷謙), nicknamed "Cold Faced Gentleman" (冷面先生).

  + Peng Yingyu (彭瑩玉), nicknamed "Peng the Monk" (彭和尚).
  + Zhou Dian (周顛), nicknamed "Lunatic" (瘋子).

- Hu Qingniu (胡青牛) is a physician residing in Butterfly Valley. He is nicknamed 'Jiansi Bujiu' (見死不救). means 'watch you die and not save you', 
  for his odd practice of treating the cult's members free of charge but not others regardless of whatever they are willing to pay. When Zhang Wuji 
  visits him, he indirectly imparts his medical knowledge to the boy and helps him slow down the effects of his injury inflicted by the Xuanming Elders. 
  Years ago, Daiqisi had brought Han Qianye to seek treatment from Hu Qingniu as they had been infected with an icy venom following their 
  duel in the icy lake. However, Hu Qingniu had refused because Han Qianye was not part of the Ming Cult; Han eventually died of poisoning. 
  Tajkis holds a grudge against Hu Qingniu and ultimately kills him to avenge Han Qianye.

- Wang Nangu (王難姑) is Hu Qingniu's wife. In contrast with her husband, she uses her mastery of toxicology to kill people. The couple become 
  rivals in a contest, in which Wang will poison someone while Hu will try to save the person's life. Sharing her husband's liking of 
  Zhang Wuji, she imparts her knowledge to Zhang by leaving behind a book on toxicology she wrote. She is killed along with her husband 
  by Tajkis when the two attempt to flee Butterfly Valley.

- Yang Dingtian (陽頂天), was the former leader of the Ming Cult and one of the most powerful figures in the jianghu in his time. One day, 
  while he was practising the Heaven and Earth Great Shift, he discovered his wife's secret affair with Cheng Kun. He was so infuriated 
  and distracted that the inner energy flow in his body was disrupted, causing him to suffer grievous internal injuries and eventually die.

  from her father and half-brothers after she killed her stepmother, and she has been despised by her father ever since. She encounters Tajkis, 
  who protects her and accepts her as an apprentice. Later, she develops feelings for Zhang Wuji when she first meets him in her childhood. 
  She is apparently murdered by Zhou Zhiruo at one point, but is eventually revealed to have survived, and then become the Junzhu in Kaifeng, 
  with the help of Ki Seung Nyang. She finally falls in love with Wang Baobao and marry him. Yin Li also the key person behind Wang Baobao's military
